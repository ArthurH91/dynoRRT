# Planners

* RRT
* RRT Connect
* Bidirectional RRT
* PRM
* Incremental PRM (similar BIT\*)
* LAZY PRM
* COMING SOON: RRT\*
* COMING SOON: PRM\*

# Collision and Robots

* Using Python bindings: You can define the collision function in PYTHON
* Robotics: Examples using Python Bindings of Pinocchio for collision checking
* In C++: Flexibility to implement whatever you want.
* In Python: Same, but it will be slower.
* COMING SOON: C++ Pinocchio Interface
* COMING SOON: C++ Collision for Point robot in 2D and 3D and spheres/boxes (maybe using hpp-fcl?, or just coding )


# How To use the code

* COMING SOON: Python Package
* COMING SOON: C++: Easy integration in CMAKE build system. As submodule, Fetch Content...
* COMING SOON: Conda Pacakge

# Benchmark

* COMING SOON:

# Test and CI

* We will have good tests and CI
